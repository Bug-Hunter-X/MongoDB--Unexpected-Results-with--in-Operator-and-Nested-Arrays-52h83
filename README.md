# MongoDB $in Operator with Nested Arrays Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `$in` operator with nested arrays in MongoDB queries.  The provided code shows the incorrect usage and the corrected approach.

The incorrect usage can lead to unexpected results where documents that should be included in the query's results are omitted. The solution demonstrates the correct method for handling nested arrays with the `$in` operator, ensuring accurate query results.

## Bug Description
Incorrect usage of the `$in` operator with nested arrays can lead to unexpected results. The query might not return the expected documents if the nested array structure is not properly handled. This is primarily due to how MongoDB evaluates the `$in` operator in relation to the document structure.

## Solution
The solution involves a restructuring of the query to correctly target the nested array elements using the dot notation or appropriate array operators. This ensures that the `$in` operator evaluates against the correct values within the nested array.
